        <p>Having recently embarked on a career change (ex. Fund Management & Investor Relations) - I am studying to become a Full Stack Web Developer.</p>

        <p>I'd 'fallen' into my previous career trajectory, and whilst I gained some valuable experience in that industry, I felt like I was not pursuing something that I was passionate about.</p>

        <p>I've always loved technology and it ticked all the boxes for me. When I assessed my skills and looked at my past work achievements, creative problem solving and building tools to improve processes were always things I'd done successfully in the past.</p>

        <p>My ultimate dream, as a newly graduated developer, would be to do work that not only solves problems but also makes a real and meaningful difference in peopleâ€™s lives. I would love to work in a collective where there is diversity in backgrounds, experience and expertise - where a pursuit of knowledge is rewarded and encouraged.</p>
